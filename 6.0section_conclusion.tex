\section{Conclusions}


Our exploration of the six research
questions listed in the introduction
show that when learning defect predictors for static code
attributes,   analytics without parameter tuning are considered {\em harmful} and {\em misleading}:
\bi
\item Tuning improves the performance scores of a predictor.
That improvement is usually positive (see \fig{deltas}) and sometimes
it can be quite   dramatic (e.g. precision changing from 0 to 60\%). \item 
Tuning changes conclusions on what learners are better than others.
Hence, it is time to revisit numerous prior publications of our own~\cite{me07b}
and others~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking,hall11}.
\item
Also,
tuning changes conclusions on what factors are most important in software development.
Once again, this means that old papers may need to be revised including those
some of our own~\cite{me02k} and others~\cite{bell2013limited,rahman2013how,Moser:2008,zimmermann2007predicting,herzig2013predicting}.
