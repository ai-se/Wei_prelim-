# written prelim report
Based on the ``Tuning for software analytics: is it really necessary?'' paper,
I added the following sections:

* Motivation: kind of literature review about software analytics tasks using data mining, almost all of these learners used
 the default parameters.....tuning are ignored in these field.... we take defect prediction as an case study to investigate the impact of tuning.
* Future work: talk about the future work I would do from current understanding about tuning
* reconstruct the paper to follow the style
